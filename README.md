# NAS IMPACT DATABASE SCRAPER
The NAS Impact Database Scraper is a Python script designed to extract impact data from the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database. Utilizing libraries such as pandas, openpyxl, BeautifulSoup, selenium, and rpy2, the script automates data scraping from the frontend of the NAS data entry portal. After manually logging in, it navigates through the database pages, extracting and cleaning impact data, including detailed descriptions and geographic locations. The processed data is merged with species information and expanded for analysis, then exported to Excel files for further use.
